# Objectified-Core
#### The modular JS framework

Objectified is a new idea for a framework I had sometime ago where each component of the framework as a whole can be included/excluded without any effect to any other component... Being able to bring in jQuery's Ajax Module and nothing else is a perfect illustration of this idea... You choose what you include and nothing more... totally configurable... 

It seems that the web takes these monolithic frameworks which are sometimes larger than the very application that is utilizing it (footprint/in terms of size)... Getting into opinions here but that is a major item that is being addressed here...
